#code challenge week 1

##CHALLENGE 1:
This is a challenge that inputs student marks which should be between(0 and 100)
Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.


CHALLENGE 2:
In this challenge, write a program that takes input of speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s 
above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

An example is if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.


CHALLENGE 3:
In this challenge write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. 
In the end calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
